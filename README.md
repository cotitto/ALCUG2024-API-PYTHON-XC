# Empowering Educators with Data: Leveraging the Canvas API and Python for Custom Reporting and Automation
The Canvas API offers a powerful suite of tools for managing and extending the functionality of the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). Paired with the canvasapi Python library developed by the University of Central Florida (UCF), institutions can unlock a new level of automation, data management, and integration. This presentation will dive into the potential of these tools to streamline processes, create custom reports, and optimize the use of Canvas LMS tasks
